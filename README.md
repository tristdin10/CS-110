## Project Description

This project is a recreation of the famous Wordle game by The New York Times. The goal of the game is to guess a 5-letter word correctly given 6 attempts. Each attempt provides information for the correct word by assigning a letter a certain color based on its position and whether it is present in the correct word. The player wins by guessing the correct word, and loses if they run out of attempts without getting the word.

## GUI Design

The design of the game is simple. Each letter of a guess is placed in a row of squares within a 5x6 grid. The background color of a square is updated in correspondense to its validity. The word is revealed on the top if the player loses.
